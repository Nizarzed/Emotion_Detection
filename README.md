#Your ML Model Repository

##Overview
This repository houses a machine learning model designed for image classification. The model is trained to recognize and predict the contents of an image based on its training data.

Features
Image Classification: Upload an image, and the model will provide accurate predictions.
Web Interface (Optional): An optional web application allows for easy interaction with the model.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
