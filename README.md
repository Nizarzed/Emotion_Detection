# Emotion Detection Model Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for emotion detection. The model is trained to recognize three main emotions: happy, sad, and angry.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Users can upload images of human faces in any format, and the model will predict whether the person appears happy, sad, or angry.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Predicted emotion labels are stored in a MongoDB database. This data may be useful for retraining the model to achieve better generalization.

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Users submit images with human faces for emotion prediction.

2. **Receive Emotion Prediction:**
   - The model processes the uploaded image and provides predictions for happiness, sadness, and anger.

3. **MongoDB Integration:**
   - Predicted emotions are stored in a MongoDB database for potential future use.

4. **Model Retraining (Optional):**
   - The stored data in MongoDB can be leveraged to retrain the model, aiming for improved generalization.
