# Your ML Model Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for image classification. The model is trained to predict the contents of an image based on its training data.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Upload an image, and the model will provide predictions.
- **Web Interface (Optional)**: An optional web application for user-friendly interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [List any specific dependencies, e.g., TensorFlow, Flask]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the prediction script:

    ```bash
    python predict.py image_path.jpg
    ```

2. Explore the web interface (if applicable):

    ```bash
